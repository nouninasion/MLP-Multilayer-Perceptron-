# MLP-Multilayer-Perceptron-
A Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) is a type of artificial neural network that is widely used in machine learning for solving problems related to classification and regression. It consists of multiple layers of nodes (neurons), including:

Input layer: Receives the input features.

One or more hidden layers: Perform nonlinear transformations and extract complex features.

Output layer: Produces the final prediction or classification.

Each neuron in one layer is connected to every neuron in the next layer through weighted connections. MLP uses a process called backpropagation for training, which adjusts these weights to minimize the error between the predicted output and the actual target.

Because of its layered structure and nonlinear activation functions, MLP can model complex relationships in data, making it suitable for a wide range of applications like image recognition, speech processing, and time series prediction.
Example Problem: Predicting New Students Enrollment for a Department
Suppose you want to build a model to predict the number of new students enrolling in a specific department for the upcoming academic year. Instead of predicting an exact number, you classify the enrollment size into four categories (classes):

- Class 1: Less than 50 students (< 50)

- Class 2: Between 50 and 100 students (50 - 100)

- Class 3: Between 100 and 150 students (100 - 150)

- Class 4: More than 150 students (> 150)

Sample Question:
You have historical data of the department's new student enrollment over the past 10 years, including factors like:

- Number of high school graduates in the region

- Number of applicants

- Average test scores

- Economic conditions

- Marketing efforts by the department

- Using this data, build a model that can classify the expected enrollment size for next year into one of the four classes above.

Additional Notes:
The target output is categorical (class labels 1 to 4), so this is a classification problem.

- Features (input variables) can be numeric or categorical.

- You can use models like Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Decision Trees, or other classification algorithms.

- Encoding the output labels as integers (1, 2, 3, 4) is necessary for training.
