Example Problem: Predicting New Student Enrollment for a Department
Step 1: Define the classes (number of categories)
We classify the number of new students enrolling into four categories:

Class 1: Less than 50 students (< 50)

Class 2: Between 50 and 100 students (50 - 100)

Class 3: Between 100 and 150 students (100 - 150)

Class 4: More than 150 students (> 150)

Step 2: Example question
You have data for the last 10 years about new student enrollment in a department, along with features like:

Number of high school graduates in the region

Number of applicants

Average entrance exam scores

Department marketing budget

Regional economic index

Your task is to build a model that predicts which enrollment category the department will fall into for the next academic year.

Step 3: Data representation example
Year	High School Graduates	Applicants	Average Score	Marketing Budget ($k)	Economic Index	Enrollment	Class Label
2014	500	120	75.2	20	80	45	1
2015	520	140	78.5	25	82	85	2
2016	600	180	80.1	30	85	110	3
2017	650	210	79.8	35	88	160	4
...	...	...	...	...	...	...	...

Enrollment: Actual number of new students.

Class Label: Corresponding class based on enrollment ranges (1, 2, 3, or 4).

Step 4: Encoding the target variable
Since the output is categorical, encode the classes as integers:

Class 1 → 0

Class 2 → 1

Class 3 → 2

Class 4 → 3

Step 5: Preparing for modeling
Use the input features (graduates, applicants, scores, budget, economic index) as input variables.

Use the encoded class label as the target variable.

Train a classification model such as an MLP (Multilayer Perceptron) to predict the class label from the input features.

Summary
This problem is a multi-class classification task, where the goal is to predict the enrollment category of new students in a department based on various factors. The output is a discrete label representing one of four enrollment size classes.
